- The application starts with an alert requesting the names of **Player 1 (X)** and **Player 2 (O)**.
- It offers classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay on a 3x3 board.
- It features a scoreboard that counts the wins for each player.
- The starting player for each match is alternated for a fairer game (in the first match X starts, in the second O starts, and so on).
- The screen background changes color to indicate whose turn it is:
    - **Light red** for player X's turn.
    - **Light blue** for player O's turn.
- At the end of a match, an alert is displayed informing the winner or if it was a draw.
- The **"Reset Game"** button clears the score and resets the starting player cycle.
- Player **X** has their moves marked in **red**, and Player **O** in **blue**.
